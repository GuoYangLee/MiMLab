Anu, Rohan, Danielle, Rob, and Ming volunteered with Georgia Blind Sports at the 2023 Southeast Regional National Qualifier goalball tournament.  We helped set up the gyms, served as judges/scorekeepers during the tournament, and met lots of amazing people within the greater blind and visually impaired community.
