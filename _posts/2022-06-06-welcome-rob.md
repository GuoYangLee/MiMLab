We are thrilled to have Robert Lamprecht join our team as a research technician!  Rob is a recent college graduate with a degree in computer science, broad research experience in neurobiology, and glowing praise from previous labs.  Rob will be helping us to set up our in-vivo electrophysiology system, and developing new paradigms for visual and optogenetic stimulation in mice.  Welcome, Rob!
