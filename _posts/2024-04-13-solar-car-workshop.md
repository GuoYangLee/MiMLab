The Fong lab organized a robotics workshop for blind and visually-impaired youth to build, modify, and race solar cars!  The idea was the brainchild of high school student, Nahreen Shamon Ayala.  Nahreen, Chao, Rob, Rohan, and Ming all participated as mentors.  The workshop took place at Clough Commons and was sponsored by the GT-Emory Department of Biomedical Engineering, the GT Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics, and Computing, and the Atlanta Center for Visually Impaired.
