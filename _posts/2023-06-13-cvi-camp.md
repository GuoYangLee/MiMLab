Rohan, Chao, Danielle, Rob, Nahreen, and Ming volunteered with at the Center for Visually Impaired (CVI) youth summer camp.  On the first day, we went grocery shopping and cooked with campers, followed by an afternoon of playing STEM games.  One the second day, we visited the High Museum of Art and made jewelry.  We had a great time getting to know the campers and look forward to an ongoing partnerships with CVI!
