We love goalball!  The lab returned for a second year to volunteer at the Southeast Regional National Qualifier goalball tournament.  Danielle, Rob, Chao, Nahreen, and Ming helped set up the nets and tape lines and serve as judges/scorekeepers.  We reconnected with friends from last year and met some new ones.
