We're excited to welcome Adam Kotar to the lab as a new research technician.  Adam joins the lab with an MS in Biomedical Engineering from University of Alabama at Birmingham and a BS in Civil Engineering from the University of South Alabama.  He has worked in breast cancer research in recent years, but we've successfully wooed him to join our efforts on neural plasticity.  Welcome, Adam!
