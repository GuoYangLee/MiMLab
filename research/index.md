[Wave Mechanics] Wave motions are the basis for mechanical signal propagation and energy transfer, laying the foundations for imaging and modulating life activities. In soft living matter, waves are highly dispersive, nonlinear, attenuative, and affected by surface and interface effects. To better understand wave motions in soft living matter, we investigate the mechanics and physics of waves and establish theories to precisely model wave motion across scales, using a combination of finite element simulations and full-wave field experiments.

[Shear Wave Imaging] Shear waves are the companion of ultrasound (longitudinal) waves in solids, with polarization approximately perpendicular to the propagation direction. Shear waves provide novel imaging contrast that reflects material stiffness, which is highly valuable for applications such as the early diagnosis of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and eye diseases. We are interested in developing novel imaging methods using shear waves across a broad frequency band (from Hz to GHz) and building super-resolution full-waveform inversion (SR-FWI) algorithms for image reconstruction. Additionally, we actively explore the application of shear wave imaging in biology and medicine.

[Meta-Imaging] Metamaterials are man-made materials with novel wave motion properties. These unique materials enable advanced wave control, allowing for the development of new imaging modalities and enhancing existing imaging methods. We focus on the enhancement of imaging through the inverse design of metamaterials to improve resolution and imaging depth, broadening the applications of traditional imaging techniques. We pay particular attention to shear wave imaging, which complements ultrasound (longitudinal) imaging and provides novel imaging contrast that reflects material stiffness. We are developing novel imaging methods using shear waves across a broad frequency band (from Hz to GHz) and building super-resolution full-waveform inversion (SR-FWI) algorithms for image reconstruction. Additionally, we actively explore the application of shear wave imaging in biology and medicine.

[US 3D Printing] Additive manufacturing has broad applications in healthcare, soft robotics, and metamaterials. We are developing ultrasound 3D/4D printing (US-3D printing) as a novel intelligent manufacturing approach to fabricate intelligent soft materials and for bioprinting. Ultimately, we aim to establish US-3D printing as an advanced manufacturing method with wide industrial applications and to translate closed-loop controlled US-3D printing to in vivo bioprinting for healthcare.
