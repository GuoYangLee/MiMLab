[Wave Mechanics] Wave motions are the basis for mechanical signal propagation and energy transfer, laying the foundations for imaging and modulating life activities. In soft living matter, waves are highly dispersive, nonlinear, attenuative, and affected by surface and interface effects. To better understand wave motions in soft living matter, we investigate the mechanics and physics of waves and establish theories to precisely model wave motion across scales, using a combination of finite element simulations and full-wave field experiments.

[Meta-Imaging] Metamaterials are man-made materials with unique wave motion properties, enabling the development of new imaging modalities and the enhancement of existing imaging methods. Our research focuses on improving imaging through the inverse design of metamaterials to achieve better resolution and imaging depth, thereby expanding the applications of traditional imaging techniques. We place particular emphasis on shear wave imaging, which complements ultrasound (longitudinal) imaging and provides novel imaging contrast that reflects material stiffness. We are developing innovative imaging methods using shear waves across a broad frequency band (from Hz to GHz) and constructing super-resolution full-waveform inversion (SR-FWI) algorithms for image reconstruction.

[US 3D Printing] Additive manufacturing has broad applications in healthcare, soft robotics, and metamaterials. We are developing ultrasound 3D/4D printing (US-3D printing) as a novel intelligent manufacturing approach to fabricate intelligent soft materials and for bioprinting. Ultimately, we aim to establish US-3D printing as an advanced manufacturing method with wide industrial applications and to translate closed-loop controlled US-3D printing to in vivo bioprinting for healthcare.
