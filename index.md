# Biomechanical imaging and modulation for living tissues
The MiM Lab, led by Prof. Guoyang Li, focuses on uncovering the fundamental wave mechanics of living tissues and developing methods and instruments to probe and modulate life activities related to growth, aging, and disease. Specific projects include elastic visco-acoustoelasticity of soft matter, optical and ultrasonic shear wave imaging, meta-imaging, and 3D/4D ultrasound printing.
