# Biomechanical imaging and modulation for living tissues
The Biomechanical Imaging and Modulation (MiM) Lab, led by Dr. Guoyang Li, focuses on uncovering the fundamental wave mechanics of living tissues and developing methods and instruments to probe and modulate life activities related to growth, aging, and disease. Specific projects include visco-acoustoelasticity of soft matter, optical and ultrasonic shear wave imaging, meta-imaging, and 3D/4D ultrasound printing. Together, we strive to solve real-world problems while satisfying our intellectual curiosity.
