# Ongoing Opportunities

<!--### Staff Positions
Technician positions open up every 1-2 years.  If you are interested in learning about future opportunities or anticipated hiring timelines, please send an inquiry to [ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu](mailto:ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu).-->

### Postdoctoral scholars
Funding for various postdoctoral opportunities is available. If you are interested in our research, you are encouraged to send an inquiry and CV to [lgy@pku.edu.cn](mailto:lgy@pku.edu.cn). The ideal candidate should have obtained a PhD within the past three years and possess a strong motivation to engage in multidisciplinary research.

计划招收博士后若干名。将协助申请自然科学青年基金、博士后科学基金等科研项目。对条件优秀者，将协助申请北京大学博雅博士后等项目。候选人应已经获得（3年内）或近期将获得相关专业（力学、声学、光学和生物医学工程等）博士学位，具备较好的英文科技论文阅读和写作能力。

### Graduate students
We accept graduate students who have already been admitted to one of the following programs: 

[Georgia Tech and Emory Joint Biomedical Engineering Program](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/georgia-tech-emory-bme-phd-program) <br>
[Emory Neuroscience Program](https://biomed.emory.edu/PROGRAM_SITES/NS/) <br>
[Georgia Tech Bioengineering Program](https://bioengineering.gatech.edu/)
[Emory MD-PhD Program](https://med.emory.edu/MDPHD/)

**We cannot directly admit graduate students into our lab.** However, if you are interested in our research, we encourage you to apply to one (or more) of the programs above.  On your application, you can list our lab as one that interests you.  If you are invited for an interview, please reach out and we will try our best to be placed on your interview schedule.  If you are offered admission and want to learn specific details about ongoing projects or joining the lab for your PhD studies (or a research rotation), please contact [ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu](mailto:ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu).

Graduate students considering joining the Fong Lab (or any neuroscience/neuroengineering lab) are strongly encouraged to enroll in the following courses:
- Georgia Tech BMED 7610 Quantitative Neuroscience (Fall only)
- Emory IBS 526 Neuroanatomy and Systems Neuroscience (Fall only)
- Emory IBS 514 Cellular, Developmental, Molecular, and Translational Neuroscience (Spring only)

Please keep the registration deadlines and cross-registration deadlines in mind.

### Undergraduate students
If you are interested in working in the lab, please fill out the [Undergraduate Research Interest Form](https://forms.office.com/r/QD7qYbh2Et).  We encourage you to fill out this form (rather than to email us directly) to demonstrate that you have read through our website and understand the expectations for undergraduate researchers in our lab.  When positions become available, lab personnel will look through the form responses to identify candidates whose interests and goals align best with their research projects.  At that time, they will reach out to candidates directly to request additional materials (e.g. resume) and schedule interviews.  This communication typically occurs 1-2 months prior to the start of the semester, with hiring occuring at the beginning of the semester.

### High school students
We cannot accept high school students into our lab unless they are part of an official program at Georgia Tech or Emory.  If you are applying for an summer internship or work-study program for high school students that has an existing partnership with Georgia Tech or Emory, feel free to notify us of your interest in the lab and we can let you know if we are eligible to take students from that program.

# Informal Mentorship

Mentorship can come in many forms, and you do not need to be a member of the Fong lab or interested in our research to seek support.  Ming-fai is open to chatting with students and postdocs on a range of topics (e.g. choosing a lab, career advice, imposter's syndrome, sexual harassment, responsible conduct of research, forming a thesis committee, etc).  Feel free to get in touch with Ming-fai if you would like to talk.
